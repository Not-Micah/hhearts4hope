          Our partners are organizations, schools, businesses, communities, etc. 
          that collaborate with Hearts for Hope to support our initiatives. 
          They provide resources, expertise, and outreach to help us implement projects and work towards our mission. 
          We also collaborate with other nonprofits to work towards helping with building both their missions, 
          and in turn ours.
